# Test_Your_Mastery_Quiz

## Description 

This project is a quiz about the animals of New Zealand and Australia. The way to win is to answer as many questions as you can before the time runs out but there is a catch, if you get a question wrong then you will loose 15 seconds of time. There are five questions to get through before the time runs out. The biggest challenge for me in this project was getting the timer to connect to so many function. In the end I go it to work out perfectly. 

here is the deployed site (https://wtekverk.github.io.Test_Your_Mastery_Quiz)

## Installation 

While the game can be played now the High Score function has still not been developed. While there is a section to fill in a winners information there still needs to be a local storage set up to retain the high scores. 

## Usage

To use this application you simply have to press start. You can answer each question simply by pressing the button that each answer is on. The game will run its course on its own.
